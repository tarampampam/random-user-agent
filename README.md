<h1 align="center">Random User-Agent</h1>
<br/>
<p align="center">Random User-Agent is an <strong>open-source</strong> MIT-licensed <strong>browser extension</strong> that is designed to replaces original browser User-Agent identifier (is a sort of "fingerprint") with a randomized. The extension is incredibly lightweight, using very few resources.</p>

<details>
  <summary>This extension may actually be making users more uniquely fingerprintable, not less?</summary>

Faking your user agent might make you _more_ fingerprintable, not less. There are ways other than `User-Agent` sniffing
to determine what browser you're using, so malicious sites could learn what browser you're _really_ using through other
means and then combine that with your randomly changing `User-Agent` to pretty effectively track you. For background,
see [this GitHub issue](https://github.com/tarampampam/random-user-agent/issues/47).

## üß© Install

Follow up by one of the links at the top üëÜ of this page, or download `CRX`/`XPI` file directly the latest release from the
[releases page][releases].

## üñ•Ô∏è Run Locally

After cloning the project, open the terminal and navigate to the project root directory (since I am a Linux adept, for
the following commands installed `docker` and `make` are required):

```bash
$ make install # install all node dependencies

$ make watch # watch for source changes

$ make shell # start shell into a container with node

$ make build # build the extension
```

After `make watch` command you can:

1. Open chrome and navigate to extensions page using this URL: `chrome://extensions`
2. Make sure "**Developer mode**" is enabled
3. Click "**Load unpacked extension**" button, browse the `./dist` directory and select it
4. Write something awesome (don't forget to make a PR after that)

## üìú How to translate (localize) this extension?

...or fix translation mistakes. The translation process described [here](./public/_locales).

## üì° Remote User-Agents list

Because the extension settings storage has size limitations - you don't have the option of keeping a large custom User-Agents list. Instead, you can place your list somewhere and link to it in the extension settings.

For example, you can create your own public repository/account on [GitHub](https://github.com/) / [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/) / [PasteBin](https://pastebin.com/) / etc. and host your list on it.

The extension will send a `GET` request to the provided location URL. Supported list format is:

```text
// will be ignored
 # will be ignored too

Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 11_4) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/93.0.4619.141 Safari/537.36
