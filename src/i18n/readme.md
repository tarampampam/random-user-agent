## How to Make Translations

1. Fork this repository
2. Determine the locale code of the language you want to translate to (you can check it [here][locale-codes])
3. Open the file [locales.ts](locales.ts) and create a copy of the `en` locale object with the name of your locale code
4. Translate all the lines
5. Ensure you translate the object comment as well, as it's used as a localized extension description in the store
6. Avoid making typing, punctuation, or grammar mistakes in the translation
7. Commit and push the changes you made to your fork
8. Submit a [pull request][new-pr]
